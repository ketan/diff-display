    # in the block are removed lines then it is a RemBlock. If the lines
    # in the block are all unmodified then it is an UnMod block. If the
    # lines in the block are a mixture of added and removed lines then
    # it is a ModBlock. There are no blocks that contain a mixture of
    # modified and unmodified lines.
